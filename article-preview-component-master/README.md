# Frontend Mentor - Article Preview Component Solution

This is a solution to the [Article Preview Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges provide an excellent opportunity to enhance coding skills by working on realistic projects.

## Overview

This repository contains my solution to the Article Preview Component challenge presented by Frontend Mentor. The challenge aimed to test my skills in creating a responsive article preview component that adjusts its layout based on the user's device screen size. Additionally, the challenge required the implementation of social media share links to be displayed when users click the share icon.
